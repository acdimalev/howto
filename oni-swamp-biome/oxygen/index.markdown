Oxygen
------

One of the most common reasons to fear slimelung is a dependence on oxygen diffusers. Building in swamp biome means that you'll inevitably dig up some slimelung-infested algae. Pair this with an oxygen diffuser and you'll have slimelung swarming your base in no time.

The solution to this problem is to instead rely on the other common source of oxygen. That's right, sand. When it comes to swamp biome, sand is oxygen, so now is a good time to start thinking that way.

You'll be building algae terrariums, but the oxygen that they produce is only a convenient side-effect.

Lay down some algae terrariums. Save room for deodorizers, and keep in mind that deodorizers can only reach polluted oxygen up to two tiles away. Three terrariums in a row is definitely not a problem. Depending on your oxygen situation, you may have to build several patches of these.

When the terrariums are emptied, they'll drop polluted water. And when they do, you're going to leave the polluted water where it lies. In the long run, this is your source of oxygen. The polluted water will emit polluted oxygen, which deodorizers will clean with sand. In the mean time, polluted oxygen is totally breathable by your dupes.

If air pressure starts looking a little gnarly, disable the terrariums. When pressure rises above 2 kg, your dupes will start stressing out from popped eardrums. The polluted water will continue producing (polluted) oxygen, and you can always re-enable the terrariums if the polluted water isn't keeping up.

Once you've reached Decontamination in your research, you'll be able to drop down deodorizers. Not only will this help clean up all that polluted oxygen hanging around your base, it will also immediately freshen the air produced by the polluted water.

Pretty soon, you should be ready to start digging into swamp biome. It's important to clean up most of the polluted oxygen in your base and disable all of the terrariums when you start. Slimelung grows on polluted oxygen, and duplicants will happily drag slimelung infected algae across your base to feed the terrariums.

From here on out, your dupes will periodically refill the deodorizers with sand, so keep an eye out for how much sand you have.

If you ever find yourself running short on oxygen, re-enable those terrariums. They will be re-emptied and you'll have more polluted water producing even more oxygen. Just be sure not to leave them running, or your dupes will start dragging infected algae all over your base and they won't be too happy about their popped eardrums either.
