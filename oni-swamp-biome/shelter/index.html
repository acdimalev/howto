<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>
<p>Building in swamp biome involves building away from the starting area. Eventually, you’ll probably just want to migrate your duplicants on over to where they’ll be working.</p>
<p>That said, there are still some really good reasons to set up a bit of a proper shelter (beyond avoiding duplicant messes and sore backs). For one, your dupes will need to take on Hard Digging to dig through that wall of granite between you and swamp biome, and that means you care about morale. For another, you definitely don’t want polluted oxygen hanging around where your duplicants sleep once you start digging through swamp biome.</p>

<p>Immediately after (or during) building a pitcher pump, build your first wash basin and an outhouse. Messes will be avoided, so long as you can get this knocked out on cycle 1. Make it a room and you’ve even got +1 morale.</p>
<p>The awkward gap between the outhouse and the wash basin is important. Eventually you’ll be putting a deodorizer there to deal with polluted oxygen.</p>

<p>Build a second wash basin and outhouse. Even with just three duplicants, it’s important to have two outhouses. Emptying an outhouse takes… a while.</p>
<p>Be sure to set the direction on the wash basins. Not only will it save time, but it will also prevent your dupes from sometimes leaving the latrine without washing their hands.</p>

<p>Build some cots. Throw a door on it and now you’ve got +2 morale. The extra space is where a deodorizer will go.</p>

<p>With the essentials in place, it’s time for research. It’ll be a while before any further additions are in order.</p>

<p>Pressure Management (Gases tier 2) comes with a nice bonus. Throw some airflow tiles over the doors. You’ll still get those nice morale benefits from having rooms, but now your duplicants will be able to breathe too.</p>

<p>Once you’ve researched Decontamination (Gases tier 3), you’ll be placing down several deodorizers. This shelter is no exception.</p>

<p>That’s it. Soon enough you’ll be moving out from these quaint quarters.</p>
