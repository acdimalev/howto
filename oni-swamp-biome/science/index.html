<p>Building in swamp biome minimally requires Decontamination (Gases tier 3) for deodorizers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that means you’ll need an advanced research station early in the game. Well, here’s a small template for getting that checked off your list.</p>

</figure>
<p>Locate a nearby body of water that you can build on top of and clear out an 11x3 area. First thing to build is a pitcher pump. This will be the water supply for the supercomputer, but for now it’s a source of water for your latrines.</p>
<p>Once the pitcher pump is built, it’s time to make sure your latrines and cots are in place. Duplicant messes and sore backs aren’t going to help with research.</p>

</figure>
<p>With the essentials in place, you’ll want to build a manual generator, research station, and battery. Be sure to leave a three-space gap for the supercomputer to fit later and a one-space gap to swap out the battery with a large battery.</p>
<p>You might want to set the priority on the research station down to 4 and open up the priority panel to set research to high for one of your duplicants. This will help keep your smartest dupe on research and all the others from hogging the station.</p>
<p>Also, while some of your dupes will need to pick up the Hard Digging skill to deal with granite, at least one of your dupes is going to need Advanced Research to use the super computer. Adjusting priorities to keep that dupe researching will make the most of your science.</p>

</figure>
<p>The first thing to research is Interior Decor (Decor tier 1). This will give you access to install a ceiling light. The Lit Workspace buff will trim off 15% of the time it takes for your dupes to run the manual generator and perform research.</p>
<p>The second thing to research is Basic Farming (Food tier 1). Seriously, get some farming going. Just some basic mealwood if you can. None of this research is going to do any good if your duplicants are dying of starvation.</p>

</figure>
<p>The third thing to research is Power Regulation (Power tier 1). It’s time to swap that battery out for a bigger battery. This will reduce research interruptions, the time that your dupes spend running around, and the amount of heat generated.</p>
<p>At this point, you’ve got two tiers of science to work through. Make sure your oxygen and farming are in good shape. If you have less than 1 kg of air throughout your base or less than 3 mealwood plants per dupe, that needs attention. Similarly, make sure you aren’t buried in carbon dioxide.</p>

</figure>
<p>The fourth and fifth things to research are Employment and Advanced Research (Colony Development tiers 1 &amp; 2). Once you have Advanced Research, it’s finally time to build that super computer.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, start gathering sand and bleach stone. The sand is required for all of the deodorizers you’re going to be installing around your base. The bleach stone is required for the hand sanitizers and chlorine chamber that you’ll want to build in your decontamination complex.</p>

</figure>
<p>The sixth, seventh, and eighth things to research are Ventilation, Pressure Management, and Decontamination (Gases tiers 1, 2, 3). With that done, you can build those deodorizers and get rid of all the polluted oxygen hanging around. Slimelung multiplies in polluted oxygen, so you’ll want to clear it all out well before digging into swamp biome.</p>
<p>The nineth and tenth things to research are Pharmacology and Medical Equipment (Medications tiers 1 &amp; 2). Take a moment to congratulate yourself. Build those hand sanitizers and start building in swamp biome.</p>
