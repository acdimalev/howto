Decontamination
---------------

Swamp biome is notoriously filled with things infested with slimelung, and if you want to build in swamp biome, you need those things to not be there. A good, efficient solution for that is to build quarantines.


### Building a Decontamination Facility

![Layout](a-1-layout.jpeg)

This layout has three different layers with bins.

The top-most layer is a quarantine for slimelung contaminated solids. The bins should be set to sweep-only, store everything but slime, and a higher than average priority. Each door should be set to allow entrance to a single duplicant. By keeping these rooms filled with oxygen, the slimelung will gradually die off.

The middle layer is a chamber for producing chlorine from bleach stone and decontaminating water. The bin should be set to store bleach stone, and a higher than average priority. Since bleach stone doesn't exist within the starting biome, you will need to go find some and dig it up.

The bottom-most layer is a quarantine for slime. The bin should be set for slime, and a higher than average priority. The door should be set to allow entrance to a single duplicant. Since slimelung grows on slime, it'll take more than some oxygen to kill it off. Eventaully this layer will be flooded with chlorine.

You will want to do something to ensure that the upper quarantines are filled with oxygen. One option is to start producing oxygen inside of the facility.

![Decontamination](a-3-decontamination.jpeg)

Place some deodorizers in front of each bin. These will clean any polluted oxygen leaking from the bins, which is important to keep the slimelung from growing.

Placing an airlock on the chlorine chamber will help keep chlorine inside.

Every time your dupes drop off some slimelung-infested thing in a bin, they're going to get their hands filthy. Wash basins aren't a very practical idea here because they take far too long for how frequently these bins are about to be used, and they require frequent refilling with clean water which you aren't going to be running into a whole lot of in the swamp biome. So build some hand sanitizers instead and set them pointing towards the doors so your dupes clean their hands on the way out.

Fortunately, you should already have some bleach stone sitting around in the chlorine chamber, so this should go quite fast.

With your quarantines up and running, you're ready to dive into the swamp biome. Slime will automatically be quarantined by your dupe with access to the slime quarantine. Be generous with deodorizers, and place a few here and there to clean up polluted oxygen as you dig. If there's any other solids contaminated with slimelung, sweep it up and one of your dupes will quarantine it.


### Chlorinating the Slime

At the moment, your slime quarantine is probably filled with carbon dioxide, which is preventing chlorine from falling in and killing off all the slimelung. Even if you manually remove the carbon dioxide now, it's only going to come back. You can, however, set up a carbon skimmer to eat all the carbon dioxide and a water purification system to deal with all the polluted water in swamp biome.

Since outhouses require dirt, which is not available in swamp biome, you'll probably find yourself in want of building toilets instead. And this water purification system will also provide the plumbing for setting up a proper washroom.

![Pump](b-1-pump.jpeg)

A water purification system will need to be primed with water. Set up a manual generator in a location that your dupes can breathe and install a jumbo battery. Then run some wire off to a liquid pump submerged in water.

If there's a body of polluted water that you want to pump up instead, then you may want to hold off until you have a water sieve installed.

![Tank](b-2-tank.jpeg)

Install a liquid tank in the chlorine chamber. This will kill off any food poisoning or slimelung present in the water. Run a liquid pipe off to the liquid pump.

![Sieve](b-3-sieve.jpeg)

Install a water sieve. Flip it around if necessary so that the output is facing toward the liquid tank.

![Plumbing](b-4-plumbing.jpeg)

If you have a liquid pump running, it's probably a good idea to disable it before splicing the water sieve into your plumbing.

Alternatively, if you were holding off to pump up some polluted water, then you'll want to start pumping after hooking up the water sieve.

![Plumbing](b-5-plumbing.jpeg)

For clean water coming out of the liquid tank, install a liquid valve. If water flows too quickly through the system, it won't have a chance to be decontaminated. Set the liquid valve to a low rate, something like 500g/s.

![Skimmer](b-6-skimmer.jpeg)

Now that you have a functioning water purification system, it's time to put it to some use. Install a carbon skimmer to get rid of all that carbon dioxide hanging around.

![Plumbing](b-7-plumbing.jpeg)

The liquid intake should come off your "clean" water pipe, straight out from the liquid valve. The liquid exhaust should dump into your "dirty" water pipe, straight into the water sieve.

After you've let this run for a while, all the carbon will slowly disappear and the bin full of slime will be surrounded by chlorine.


### Pumping out Contaminants

Eventually, you'll notice that some nasty air or other has gotten stuck in the chlorine chamber and the bleach stone has stopped producing chlorine. At this point, it's time to install a gas pump.

This requires automation and refined metals. If you don't have those, now is a good time to work on them.

![Pump](c-1-pump.jpeg)

Install the gas pump in the chlorine chamber.

![Pressure](c-2-pressure.jpeg)

Hook the gas pump up to an atmo sensor, and set the sensor to turn green when pressure is above 1kg. This will help remove all of the contaminants and keep pressure low enough for the bleach stone to keep producing chlorine.

![Vent](c-3-vent.jpeg)

Vent from the chlorine chamber down to the slime quarantine. After all of the contaminants have been cleared out, this will keep the slime quarantine flooded with chlorine, even when your dupes aren't letting themselves into the chlorine chamber for bleach stone.

![Done](c-4-done.jpeg)

That's it. The decontamination facility should be fairly hands-free. If the bins fill up, see if there's anything completely disinfected that could be emptied from them. If bleach stone runs out, go fetch some more. If the plumbing system backs up, maybe drain some of that clean water somewhere.
