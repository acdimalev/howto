% Decontamination // Slimelung Quarantine

Early in the game, your options for decontamination are limited.  You can, however, quarantine the slimelung to let a lot of it die off, and clean your dupes hands in the process.

By planning ahead a bit and digging out this 16-wide by 17-high facility, you'll be able to quarantine the slimelung now, clean the polluted water and build some washrooms soon enough, and properly exterminate the contamination later.

You'll need a duplicant with hard digging to deal with the granite.  By this time, you should have basic farming researched.

While you're digging out the space, you'll want to place down a few algea terrariums and a storage bin.  This space will need to be filled with oxygen to be of any use, and you'll want to start collecting bleach stone as soon as possible.

Place the storage bin one level down from the entrance, set it to collect bleach stone, and set the priority up to six.  Since chlorine is heavier than oxygen, this will keep the gas down where you want it.  Start scavaging around for bleach stone because you're going to need plenty of it.

Once you have decontamination researched, it's time to build some deoderizers to clean up all the polluted air.  It takes some time to clean up, and you'll want it to be pretty fresh before anything besides bleach stone is stored here.

While you're at it, build an airlock for the bleach stone storage.  This will help fill the room with chlorine, which will later be useful for killing germs off of water.

Once you have medical equipment researched, you're finally ready to build the quarantines.  Start with the slime quarantine.

Build a storage bin along the inside wall of the room and a hand sanitizer toward the outside.  You'll want to set the direction on the hand sanitizer toward the door.  This will keep your dupes hands clean after dropping off slime in the soon-to-be disgusting bin.  Set the priority on the storage bin to 6.

Build a door to the room along with an airflow tile above it, just to make sure no gasses get stuck in the room.

At this point, you're ready to assign a duplicant to picking up slime.  Modify the door permissions so that only a single duplicant can get into the room, and set the bin to store slime and polluted dirt.

The top two rooms will be quarantines for other slimelung infested materials.  Unlike the slime below which will eventually be decontaminated by chlorine, slimelung will naturally die off on other materials when surrounded by clean air.

Set these up the same way you did the slime quarantine, except mark the bins as sweep only, and choose materials likely to be infected by slimelung, like algea.

![Step 5: done](5-done.jpeg)

Go ahead and start digging through the swamp biome!  Take it a bit slow and check the germ overlay frequently until you have a feel for how fast you can safely go.  One of your dupes should be automatically running all of the slime to the storage bin.  When you spot other materials sitting on the ground, mark it to be swept up and a dupe will drop it off at one of the other bins.
